## Results

![preview](https://github.com/minidmnv/aoc2022/blob/master/assets/results/01-result.jpg?raw=true)

|     Task    | Execution time | Iterations |
|   ---       |----------------|    ---     |
| 01 Basic    | TBD            |      1     |
| 01 Advanced | TBD            |      1     |

## Usage

### Use correct node version
>nvm use

### Install dependencies
> npm install

### Run

To run one of scripts
> npm run 01-basic

Very often advanced scripts are using basic scripts to not repeat myself, so You can get multiple results.

## Structure
- Tasks are grouped in directories with number named by complexity, so day 1 will be directory 01 with two files underneath basic.ts and advanced.ts
- There will be also input.txt file in each directory
- Utils scripts will be placed in utils directory
