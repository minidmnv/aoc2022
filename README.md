# Advent of Code 2022 (Typescript)

Repository to keep solutions for Advent of Code 2022 edition. this time I decided to take it in Typescript.

## [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/)

Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of fifty stars by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!

## Usage

### Use correct node version
>nvm use

### Install dependencies
> npm install

### Run

To run one of scripts
> npm run 01-basic

> npm run 02-advanced

Very often advanced scripts are using basic scripts to not repeat myself, so You can get multiple results.

## Structure
- Tasks are grouped in directories with number named by complexity, so day 1 will be directory 01 with two files underneath basic.ts and advanced.ts
- There will be also input.txt file in each directory
- Utils scripts will be placed in utils directory
